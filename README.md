Team Stardust - Holepuncher (working title)
Hello, welcome to the readme collaborators!

I'm going to outline how to use git with this project here.

Definitions:

git - git is for tracking revisions to software on your own computer in such a way as to not over write the main stable version of the program, by keeping your work in progress in a "branch" separate from the master copy. Once your branch is working git lets you safely merge your changes into the main branch. Git also lets you "push" your local changes (including all your branches and stuff) to a server, and new versions online can be downloaded and merged with your local version. Changes can be easily reverted, because git keeps a history of your commits. Commits sort of make changes official, and you have to commit your changes before pushing. 

github - a server for git that provides nice features and a cool interface. 

github desktop - much easier interface for git. Especially with pushing to the server.


I realized I am not writing this in a branch right now, so I am going to do that. First I am going to commit what I have to master though.
